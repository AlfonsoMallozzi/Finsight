## 🎯 Inspiration

Y&M Consulting Inc. was born from the disconnect between **traditional credit analysis** and **modern, data-driven tools**.  

Banks still rely on static spreadsheets and manual reviews, while small businesses (PYMEs) struggle to understand why their credit requests are approved or denied.  

We set out to change that.

### Dual-Perspective Design
- 🏦 **For Financial Institutions:** Robust, AI-driven tools for confident credit decisions.  
- 💼 **For PYMEs:** Transparent insights and actionable recommendations to improve financial standing.  

Our design embraces a **professional, trustworthy aesthetic** with a red-accented palette symbolizing innovation and confidence in finance.

## 🏗️ How We Built It

Y&M Consulting Inc. is a **React 18 + TypeScript** web app powered by **Supabase** and **OpenAI GPT-4o**, designed for real-time financial analysis and credit scoring.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4  
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4o for trend analysis and recommendations  
- **Visualization:** Recharts + custom dynamic widgets  
- **Caching:** In-memory cache layer for fast, cost-efficient AI responses  

### 💻 Architecture Highlights
- Dual login flows (Business / Financial Institution) with unique dashboards  
- Real-time Supabase queries for live financial data  
- JSONB fields to store monthly performance data  
- Modular component system — 60+ widgets across 10 dashboard sections

## 📚 What We Learned

- How to architect a **full-stack AI platform** with React, Supabase, and OpenAI.  
- How to implement **weighted credit-scoring logic** using financial indicators.  
- How to achieve **100× faster AI response times** through caching and optimization.  
- How to enforce **data consistency, validation, and typing** with TypeScript.  
- The value of **reusable, modular components** across multiple dashboards.

## 💪 Challenges We Overcame

- **🧩 JSON Parsing Reliability:** GPT-4o sometimes returned malformed JSON → built regex cleanup & validation pipeline.  
- **📈 Time-Series Optimization:** Replaced heavy SQL JOINs with Supabase JSONB → faster queries, simpler schema.  
- **💸 AI Cost Management:** Implemented smart caching → reduced API cost by ~85% ($500 → $75/month).  
- **⚖️ Credit Score Calibration:** Designed non-linear scoring inspired by FICO

- **🔄 Real-Time Data:** Replaced mock values with live Supabase-driven queries.
